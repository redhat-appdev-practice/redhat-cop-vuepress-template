# Welcome!

You have found the home of the Red Hat Communities of Practice (CoP) and we are so happy to have you join us.
The Communities of Practice are self-organized groups of people inside and outside of Red Hat who are
passionate about their areas of interest. These areas are both technical and non-technical and are
a vital component of our Open Source DNA at Red Hat.

Each CoP has two or more practice leads chosen from their community. Those practice leads assist
their communities to develop content, tips, guides, and a multitude of other content which
they feel help our associates and our customers.

Clicking on the [Communities](/communities/) link here or above will take you to a list of communities that
have opted to be included in this site and those links should take you to their content.
